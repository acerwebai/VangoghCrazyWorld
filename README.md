# Vangogh Crazy World

Here are a few pictures that are suitable for conversion into Van Gogh paintings. Together with selected classic Van Gogh paintings, you can use the artificial intelligence technology of style transfer to let you experience Van Gogh in modern scenes and draw it.


******this sample is under cooking **************

One Paragraph of project description goes here, example: Neural Style Transfer, Van Gogh Crazy World
Descriptions:
* Background, example: Learning what is neural style transfer 
* Motivation, example: We would like to pay tribute to MR. Van Gogh, who is the ...
* Experience, example: A full package of build neural style transfer training on Linux and Android inference applications (and Windows link in another repository)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
CUDA (optional)
cuDNN (optional)
Python
Python packages
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone source code
```

```
CUDA (optional)
```

```
cuDNN (optional)
```

```
Python
```

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu and more
This can be done automatically by a script file
```

```
install Android Studio
```

```
until finished
```

If possibile, end with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Training

Explain how to do the training with the script

```
Give an example
```

### Tuning parameters

Explain parameters and how to tuning parameters to see different results with the script

```
Give an example
```


## Testing

Explain how to do the testing with the script and show the results

```
Give an example
```

## Transfer Taining, build your own model

Explain how to build your model with your data with the script

```
Give an example
```
