# Vangogh Crazy World

## Neural style transfer

Neural style transfer is the process of taking the style of one image then applying it to the content of another image.

Offering you a variety of beautiful styles some of which are paintings by famous artists like Starry Night by Van Gogh.


## Vincent van Gogh

For more Vincent van Gogh, please refer to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh)

## Tensorflow

The source code in this project is written in Tensorflow

For more Vincent van Gogh, please refer to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


## Experience

We would like to bring you to Vangogh Crazy World, insight the sample code, you can use pre-trained model or you can try to train your own models.

After that you can decided to deploy on various devices which running on to Windows or Android and even OS independent web pages.

## Features

In this project, it will provide the following packages
* Training Van Gogh gallery with Python
* Inference with real time camera and still images and 
  * Deployment on Windows applications
  * Deployment on Android applications
  * Deployment on web pages



## Getting Started


### Getting the Code

```
git clone https://github.com/acerwebai/VangoghCrazyWorld.git
```

### Get Pre-Trained Model
You can download the pre-trained models from here and should find the checkpoint files for each models

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6

* (Optional) If your machine support [nVidia GPU with CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus), please refer to the installation from nVidia 
	* CUDA: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/
	* cuDNN: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html
	* Note: CUDA and cuDNN has [dependencies](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-support-matrix/index.html)

### Create Virtual Environment

In creating a virtual environment you will create a directory containing a python binary and everything needed to run VangoghCrazyWorld.

Firstly, you need to install virtualenvwrapper via

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

Then you can create a virtual environment using this command:

```
virtualenv -p python3 $HOME/tmp/VangoghCrazyWorld-venv/
```

And activate the virtual environment like this 

```
source $HOME/tmp/VangoghCrazyWorld-venv/bin/activate
```

In that, you can isolate the working environments project by project.

So, please workon this virtual environment for the following installations.

### Installing

Change directory to VangoghCrazyWorld, where the git clone goes

```
cd VangoghCrazyWorld
```

We have already make all required packages listing in the requirements.txt, all you need to do is just to pip install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: If your machine do not support nVidia GPU, please replace Tensorflow-gpu as Tensorflow inside the requirements.txt


### Run Pre-Trained Models
Now, you have all the packages for running the pre-trained models
You can have a trial run the starrynight style model that we have pre-trained, from the as following 

```
python evaluate.py --checkpoint path/to/style/starrynight \
  --in-path dir/of/test/imgs/ \
  --out-path dir/for/results/
 
```

where
* --checkpoint: is the path where you place the pre-trained model checkpoint
* --in-path: is the path to input images, can be a folder or a file
* --out-path: is the path to output images, can be a folder or a file

## Training

Let's start to do the training

```
python style.py --style path/to/style/starrynight.jpg \
  --checkpoint-dir checkpoint/path \
  --test path/to/test/img.jpg \
  --test-dir path/to/test/dir \
  --content-weight 1.5e1 \
  --checkpoint-iterations 1000 \
  --batch-size 20
```

where
* --checkpoint-dir: is the path to save checkpoint in
* --style: style image path
* --train-path: path to training images folder
* --test: test image path
* --test-dir: test image save dir
* --epochs: number of epochs
* --batch-size: number of images feed for a batch
* --checkpoint-iterations: checkpoint save frequency
* --vgg-path: path to VGG19 network
* --content-weight: content weight
* --style-weight: style weight
* --tv-weight: total variation regularization weight
* --learning-rate: learning rate

### Tuning parameters
The Loss function of the style transfer can be illustrated as

``` 
Loss = alpha*C_loss(C_Lys, C, G) + beta*S_Loss(S_Lys, S, G)
```

Therefore, we can tuning the total loss via  

* --content-weight
* --style-weight

For more tuning techniques, please refer to [this medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-techniques-for-getting-style-transfer-to-work-19884a0d69eb) 


## Testing

You can evaluate the trained models via

```
python evaluate.py --checkpoint path/to/style/starrynight \
  --in-path dir/of/test/imgs/ \
  --out-path dir/for/results/
```

## Transfer Taining, build your own model

You can change the style image whatever you would like to train

```
python style.py --style path/to/style/img.jpg \
  --checkpoint-dir checkpoint/path \
  --test path/to/test/img.jpg \
  --test-dir path/to/test/dir \
  --content-weight 1.5e1 \
  --checkpoint-iterations 1000 \
  --batch-size 20
```
### Find Your Checkpoint

You should find the checkpoint @--checkpoint-dir folder

### Frozen Model

You should find the checkpoint @--checkpoint-dir folder

We use the Tensorflow [freeze_graph.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.py) to make it frozen

We need frozen model for deployment to various devices in Windows or Android, or even OS independent web pages

## Deployment

For the deployment, please follow the instructions below

## Built With

### Android APP
See [Android Application](https://github.com/acerwebai/VangoghCrazyWorld/blob/master/Chromebook/README.md)
### Windows APP
See [Windows_README.md](Windows_README.md)
### Web pages
See [Web_README.md](Web.md)

## Implementation Details
The implementation is based on the [Fast Style Transfer in TensorFlow from ](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) from [lengstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer/commits?author=lengstrom)

It use roughly the same transformation network as described in Johnson, except that batch normalization is replaced with Ulyanov's instance normalization, and the scaling/offset of the output tanh layer is slightly different. We use a loss function close to the one described in Gatys, using VGG19 instead of VGG16 and typically using "shallower" layers than in Johnson's implementation (e.g. we use relu1_1 rather than relu1_2). Empirically, this results in larger scale style features in transformations.
